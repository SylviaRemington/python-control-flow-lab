# Control Flow Lab

### About
Welcome to the Python Control Flow Lab! In this lab, youâ€™ll practice implementing control flow in Python, which includes making decisions with conditional statements, repeating actions with loops, and managing user input.

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
- Handle user input effectively and safely to make your programs interactive.
- Use if, elif, and else statements to make decisions in your code.
- Combine logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to make more complex conditional statements.
- Utilize loops to repeat actions and process sequences.

### Getting Started
- For each exercise, copy the provided code into a new Python script file named exercises.py.
- Each exercise will include a function where you will write your code. The function structure is provided to help you focus on implementing the specific control flow logic required.
- Follow the exercise instructions carefully to complete the code.
- After completing each exercise, run python3 exercises.py in your terminal to see the output and test your code.
